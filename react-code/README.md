## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Designing a visually appealing card layout for showcasing different options
- Implementing hover effects for interactive elements to enhance user experience
- Creating a responsive design for seamless viewing on various devices

code snippet I am proud of-
```css
.feature__btn {
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-top: 8.2rem;
  margin-left: 0.15rem;
  font-size: 1.57rem;
  padding: 1.5rem 3rem;
  border-radius: 10rem;
  border: none;
  background: var(--very-light-gray-background-headings-buttons);
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: all 0.15s ease;
}

.feature__btn:hover {
  background: transparent;
  outline: 1px solid var(--very-light-gray-background-headings-buttons);
}
```

### Continued Development

- Adding additional features such as filtering and sorting options for improved user navigation
- Integrating backend functionality to enable dynamic content loading based on user preferences
- Enhancing accessibility features to ensure a smooth experience for all users

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in JavaScript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
